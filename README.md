#Angular Single Page Application with Node.js and MongoDB

###April 15th Update
*Switched form to use MongoDB instead of FireBase* 

##Angular UI-Router
This repository contains a highly scalable Angular application that utilizes different named views. Below, I have included all of the code displayed in the `home` state. With the help of UI-Router, it is easy to define different sections of an application according to their parent, or absolute state. Not only does this look better sematically, but it makes adding, or removing elements from a page an extremely menial task. You can see more info about absolute views in the [UI-Router docs]('https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Multiple-Named-Views').

*note: due to problems regarding the paths of my script, and template files, I currently have a single app.js in place, however you will notice a much more modular approach in the js file*


```
<div ui-view="Header"></div>
<div class="wrap">
    <div ui-view="Main-Content"></div>
</div>
<div ui-view="Footer"></div>
```


##Susy Custom Grid
In addition to coming configured with Angular, the following SPA has been created using the Susy grid framework. I have kept the debug option on, so that anyone can easily get started in creating a custom grid made up of however many columns. In this specific case, I utilized a 12 column grid.

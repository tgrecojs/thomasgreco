    <h2 class="main-heading">Welcome to thomasgreco.me</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for visiting my web application. My name is Thomas Greco, and I am a web developer based out of New York City. Specifically, my main focus is building web applications with the help of isomorphic JavaScript. This application was custom built by myself using the M.E.A.N. stack. By visiting this applications <a ui-sref="about">technologies state</a>, you can read more about the specific things I focused on when building this application.
        <br>
        <br> In addition to programming thomasgreco.me, I also created the layout, and designed the logo using Adobe Illustrator. Before focusing on web development, I worked in graphic design, which had a tremendous impact on the way I approach development. Moreover, I value the proper use of design to help achieve the best possible user experience.
        <br>
        <br> If you are interested in working with me, or simply have a question, fill out this <a ui-sref="contact">contact form</a> and I will get back to you as soon as possible!

    <h2 class="main-heading">My Ghost Blog</h2>
    <p>As a self-taught developer, one of the biggest regrets I have was not documenting my work by means of a blog. I was constantly seeking knowledge, and felt as though I was not skilled enough to give advice. Now, however, I haved reached the point in where I believe I can truly provide information that can be wholly benefical to those striving to learn about different technologies in web development. Therefore, this blog will consist of short, person pieces about my experiences with different technologies, as well as articles that I have had published on <a href="http://sitepoint.com" target="_blank">SitePoint.com</a>. That said, I recently rekindled my position at SitePoint after dedicating a few months towards gaining certain knowledge regarding development. In turn, I am now extremely confident in my work as well as my writing, and I am excited to see what is to come.
